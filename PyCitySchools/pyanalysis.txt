Analysis

1. Math performance at smaller and medium sized schools greatly surpassed that of larger schools (91% v 67%.

2. Charter schools showed a trend of outperforming public schools in nearly every metric. However, additional research will be required to make any definitive conclusions. 

3. Higher spending did not correlate with increased results or passing rates. In many cases, higher budget schools underperformed the lowest tier budgets (<$585.00).
